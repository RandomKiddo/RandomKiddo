### Hi there, I'm RandomKiddo!

### About Me (Not Programming Related):

Besides coding, I love multiple things like playing tennis, learning about physics and the universe (stars, black holes, etc). I like math and science
a lot (you probably could have guessed that). I also love playing video games too, including but not limited to, Minecraft, Stardew Valley, Rocket League,
any Mario game, and Bloons Tower Defense! I also enjoy partaking in social activities, and love to photograph animals and landscapes. There is so much more
to know about me, but I'm not writing an autobiography here, so I'm just going to stop here.

### Main Languages:

I know these languages very well!

- Java
- Python3
- Fortran
- C
- C++

### Tools:

The stuff that lets me do stuff!

- VSCode (Python, Fortran, C, C++)
- BlueJ (Java)
- Eclipse (Advanced Java)
- Terminal
- Brackets (HTML, CSS, Javascript, Website Development)

### Other Languages:

I know these fairly well but I either don't use them often, or I don't use them anymore! (I wouldn't ask me for help on these)

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- Swift
- C#
